          <p>
            The Andamans have a rich and painful history, most notably at the
            infamous Cellular Jail in Port Blair. Built by the British in the
            19th century, this jail was used to exile Indian freedom fighters.
            Today, it stands as a museum, a solemn reminder of India's struggle
            for independence.
